<img src="intro.gif" style="max-width:100% !important "></img>

## Description

This is a template for making Windows software with **HTML, CSS, js** and **Python** as the backend. At first, I used Flask for making simple registration verification user information gathering applications and then I added GUI using **PyQt5**.

Using PyQt we have URLs to Flask websites and using as tabs in my application.  URLs are in the localhost server and You can use your ip for going to that website with a smartphone, pc, or laptop device.

## If you want to use that device:
* Write command in terminal (CMD)
```cmd 
ipconfig
```
* Get IP4 address
* And use URL https://your-ip-address:5000 

application has an id and phone validation as well as  a user management panel with search, also, it exports data to Excel "user_data.xlsx" file every time you add users.

## To Run

* run runner.bat which is in **scripts** folder
